# DacTaFie
DacTaFie：Dual-Layer Agent Collaboration with Test-Time Adaptation for Form Information Extraction

## Introduction
Form Information Extraction (FIE) is a critical task in document understanding but faces challenges such as poor domain adaptability, weak tool-awareness of agents, and low scalability.  
To address these issues, we propose **DacTaFie**, a dual-layer agent collaboration framework with test-time adaptation.  
It dynamically optimizes plugin execution chains, enabling efficient parsing of complex forms and robust cross-domain generalization **without model fine-tuning**.


## Datasets
We evaluate DacTaFie on three datasets:
Ad-buy form: public dataset for visually rich form understanding.
CORD: public receipt dataset.
BANK: private dataset (commercial bank statements, not publicly available due to confidentiality).

## Usage
1. We provide the required environment dependencies in requirements.txt.
2. Configure your OpenAI client in main.py:
```Python
client = OpenAI(
    api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',
    base_url='YOUR_BASE_URL'
)
```
3. Run the pipeline:
```Python
python main.py
```
