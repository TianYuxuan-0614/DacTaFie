DacTaFieï¼šDual-Layer Agent Collaboration with Test-Time Adaptation for Form Information Extraction

#**Introduction**
Form Information Extraction (FIE) is a critical task in document understanding but faces challenges such as poor domain adaptability, weak tool-awareness of agents, and low scalability.  
To address these issues, we propose **DacTaFie**, a dual-layer agent collaboration framework with test-time adaptation.  
It dynamically optimizes plugin execution chains, enabling efficient parsing of complex forms and robust cross-domain generalization **without model fine-tuning**.


#**Datasets**
We evaluate DacTaFie on three datasets:
Ad-buy form: public dataset for visually rich form understanding.
CORD: public receipt dataset.
BANK: private dataset (commercial bank statements, not publicly available due to confidentiality).
